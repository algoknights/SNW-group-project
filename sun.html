        Two bike messengers race daylight to deliver apologies across a neon skyline.
        One carries the letter; the other carries the courage to hand it over.

      <h2>Story</h2>

      <p class="desc">
        The city hummed in violet and gold as Ari tightened their helmet strap.
        “We’ve got forty minutes before the bridge lights cut off. Think we make it?”
      </p>

      <p class="desc">
        “If you stop overthinking,” Sol said, bumping their bikes together.
        The envelope in their jacket felt heavier than it looked—Ari’s apology,
        folded neatly, everything they couldn’t say out loud.
      </p>

      <p class="desc">
        They slipped into traffic, weaving between taxis and puddles that caught neon like candy.
        Every red light was a confession Ari almost made;
        every near-miss was Sol pretending not to wish the letter had their name on it.
      </p>

      <p class="desc">
        Halfway across the river, a gust lifted the envelope.
        Sol caught it mid-air, laughing a little too softly.
        “You’re allowed to want things,” they said, pressing it back into place.
      </p>

      <p class="desc">
        By the time they reached the apartment, sunset had already surrendered to violet.
        Ari’s hands shook, so Sol knocked. When the door opened, the words spilled—
        all the regret, all the missing, all the not-quite promises the letter hadn’t managed.
      </p>

      <p class="desc">
        On the ride home, the streets glowed sleepy and warm.
        Sol’s voice broke the quiet first. “Any of that meant for me?”
        Ari exhaled like they’d been holding that breath for months.
        “All of it. Stay for tea?”
      </p>
